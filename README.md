First Iteration Code should is a python script which aims to connect users (mentors & mentees) based on homophily datapoints.
For running the code both files (.first_iteration.py and first_it_df.txt) must be downloaded and saved in the same folder.
Recommend to run code in Spyder or Visual Studio, as Jupyter Notebook does not run the whole code at once. 

The following files are to be found here:

* 1)final_gra_data_cleaning_mentee_ch.ipynb
* 2)final_gra_data_cleaning_mentors_ch.ipynb
* 3)final_gra_data_cleaning_mentors_eu.ipynb
* 4)gra_Raimundo_Burchardt_data_cleaning_final_first_iteration.ipynb
* 5)gra_Raimundo_Burchardt_data_cleaning_exploration_final_dataset.ipynb
* 6) first_it python script + data
* 7) second_it python script + data
