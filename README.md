First Iteration Code should is a python script which aims to connect users (mentors & mentees) based on homophily datapoints.
For running the code both files (.first_iteration.py and first_it_df.txt) must be downloaded and saved in the same folder.
Recommend to run code in Spyder or Visual Studio, as Jupyter Notebook does not run the whole code at once.
